# QuizKata

Direct Supply Interview Kata, Option 1, focused mostly on demonstrating backend skills and knowledge
Implements the taking of quizzes, the tracking of time, and a leaderboard where the best scores in the least time can be seen
Essentially, the core functionality + leaderboards

# To Run

Make sure node package manager is installed
go to the backend directory and "npm install"
Then, run "npm run build" + "npm run start"
The server should start properly, with localhost:4000 as the frontend and localhost:4000/graphql as the GraphQL handler (it is a bit of an abomination that the frontend is at 4000 but I am not good enough at frontend to link them together semalessly)

# Helped By:

A lot of Stack Overflow for the CSS
GraphQL + Prisma documentation for the backend
GPT-4o for debugging and frontend integration
openTriviaAPI for their API
Some of my previous projects (for which I ripped out a lot of html and javascript from)
